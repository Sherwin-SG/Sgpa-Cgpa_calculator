## Calculations

### SGPA Calculation

To calculate SGPA for a semester, use this formula:

\[ \text{SGPA} = \frac{\text{Total Grade Points}}{\text{Total Credits}} \]

- **Total Grade Points:** Add up (Grade Points for Each Course × Credits for Each Course).
- **Total Credits:** Sum of credits for all courses in the semester.

**Example Calculation:**

- Course 1: Grade = 4.0, Credits = 3
- Course 2: Grade = 3.5, Credits = 4
- Total Grade Points = (4.0 × 3) + (3.5 × 4) = 26
- Total Credits = 3 + 4 = 7
- SGPA = 26 / 7 ≈ 3.71

### CGPA Calculation

To calculate CGPA, use this formula:

\[ \text{CGPA} = \frac{\text{Total Weighted SGPA}}{\text{Total Credits}} \]

- **Total Weighted SGPA:** Add up (SGPA for Each Semester × Credits for Each Semester).
- **Total Credits:** Sum of credits for all semesters.

**Example Calculation:**

- Semester 1: SGPA = 3.71, Credits = 7
- Semester 2: SGPA = 3.85, Credits = 6
- Total Weighted SGPA = (3.71 × 7) + (3.85 × 6) = 49.07
- Total Credits = 7 + 6 = 13
- CGPA = 49.07 / 13 ≈ 3.77
